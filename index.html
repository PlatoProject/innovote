	<h3>Just Use Your Phone!</h3>
	<div class="description">
		<p>In recent years, many jurisdictions have moved backwards to paper ballots, as proprietary touchscreen technology was not up to the task. That’s why Inno.vote’s technology is built to run on today’s smartphones and tablets.</p>

	</div>
	<ul class="feature clear">
		<li class="ios-android"><h3>Built for Today.</h3><p>The core apps will contain all the functionality that a voter needs to interact with their local elections authority. Where Inno.vote technology is deployed, voters will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Register to Vote</li>
  <li>Manage their Registration</li>
  <li>Sign and circulate petitions or measures</li>
  <li>Vote in Elections</li>
</ul>

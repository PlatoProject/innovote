    <h3>Built for Today.</h3>
		<p>In recent years, many jurisdictions have moved backwards to paper ballots, as proprietary touchscreen technology was not up to the task. That’s why Inno.vote’s technology is built to run on today’s smartphones and tablets.</p>
  </div>
	<ul class="feature clear">
		<li class="ios-android">
      <p>The core apps will contain all the functionality that a voter needs to interact with their local elections authority. Where Inno.vote technology is deployed, voters will be able to:
        <ul>
          <li>Register to Vote</li>
          <li>Manage their Registration</li>
          <li>Sign and circulate petitions or measures</li>
          <li>Vote in Elections</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </li> 
  </ul>
	<div class="description">
		<p>Though the Inno.vote platform provides a complete elections solution, it can integrate seamlessly with other voting schemes and is ideal for implementing UOCAVA voting while maintaining ballot secrecy and election integrity.</p>

    <h3>Assistive tech that lets everyone’s voice be heard.</h3>
    <div class="description">
      <img src="img/universal-access.png" class="padded right-image" />
      <p>By creating mobile apps, Inno.vote can take advantage of the state of the art accessibility that is built into the iOS and Android operating systems. These operating systems support assistive technologies for hearing, vision, and mobility impaired users. By letting people use their own devices to vote, we provide the ultimate in accessibility as voters can use the devices with which they are already familiar, rather than having to learn a new system, just to vote.</p>

    <h3>Provably secure, tamper-proof elections software.</h3>
    <img src="img/lock-closed.png" class="padded left-image" />
    <p>Security is the primary focus of the elections software created by Inno.vote. Legacy elections software providers keep their source code secret because it is not secure. How can we trust the results of a system whose inner workings are kept a secret?</p>

    <p>The software is built on best-of-breed encryptions and security technology, such as those that underpin the [[Bitcoin blockchain]], [[RSA]], [[Threefish]] and [[SHA2]].</p>

    <h3>The software that runs freedom must be free.</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Inno.vote is committed to freeing the software that underpins freedom. All of the core code is released as Open Source Software under a MySQL style license, where not for profit open source developers can use SecureVote code under the GPL, and commercial developers can purchase a license to use the SecureVote code. Because security should not rely on secrecy, all SecureVote code will be open, forever.</p>

        <h3>SecureVoter</h3>
        <p>The SecureVoter suite of software is a complete system for running elections, including elections management software, a registration database, a poll book, a tabulator and mobile phone applications.</p>

      <li class="ballotchain">
        <h3>BallotChain</h3>
        <p>The BallotChain is an innovative Bitcoin style altchain that acts as a distributed ballot box. The BallotChain approach makes elections tamper-proof, and ensures transparency and verifiability to every vote cast, giving voters complete confidence in election results.</p>
